# Recursive-ViT
ViT trained and tested with multiple passes; this method might be a good idea because Linear transformers are fast weight mechanisms according to Shimudhuber's paper, 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11174. Because transformers are fast weight mechanisms, ViT might be able to detect what level of proccessing the information it recives has been 
through and refine what patterns it looks for, making it more suitibule for recursive learning than traditional CNNs. A recursively more accurate machine learning system is 
extremely desirable beacuase the majority of compute resources are used in training time and with a recursive system accuracy could be increased with an evening of that compute 
allocation.
